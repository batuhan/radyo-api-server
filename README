###WARNING: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, THINGS MAY (AND WILL) GO WRONG###

This little app provides a clean API for Shoutcast1 by converting it's XML to JSON.

But that's not it, it also provides some features you may find usefull:

1) getting broadcaster (and their guests') information with Twitter.
    Putting your Twitter in AIM section of Shoutcast Yellow Pages will provide information from Twitter,
also if you write more than 1 username (comma separated) (ie. "batuhanicoz,pacacican,kaloglu"), this application will
assume first one is the broadcaster and others are guests.


2) Hides IP's of people connected.
    Normally, in (password restriced) XML (ip:port/admin.cgi?mode=viewxml&pass=YOURADMINPASS) there are IP's of the people connected,
this is something you DO want to hide from people. In this application people CAN NOT see IP information unless they provide an API key.

3) You can kick listeners OR the broadcaster.
    


This application is orginally written for Razyo (http://razyo.com) by using FatFreeFramework, after the acquisition of Razyo by SosyalRadyo,
we needed something more powerful. For these needs we're re-writing (yeah, the biggest mistake!) that application by using Silex.
