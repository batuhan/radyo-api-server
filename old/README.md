###OLD VERSION###

This directory contains razyo api v0.8, here are some notes about it:

1) Its variables, comments and functions are in *Turkish*.
2) It only supports Shoutcast v1.x
3) You need to set your server information in veriler/bilgiler.php
4) I used FatFreeFramework and you need to install F3 yourself to make it work. 
    Just install it and then correct the necessary information in web/index.php
